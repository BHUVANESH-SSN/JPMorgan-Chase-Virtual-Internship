# JPMorgan Chase Forage Job Simulation ‚Äì Midas Core Backend

This repository contains the solution to the **JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program** on Forage. The project simulates a core part of a banking system ‚Äî the **Midas Core backend** ‚Äî which processes and stores user financial transactions with real-time incentive logic via Kafka and external APIs.

---

## üíº About the Project

The **Midas Core** system is a backend Spring Boot application that:
- Receives transaction messages via **Kafka**
- Applies incentives via an external incentive service
- Stores users and transactions in a **relational database**
- Exposes a REST API to check user balances

This simulation provides experience with real-world technologies used at JPMorgan Chase & Co., including microservices, messaging systems, automated testing, and external service integration.
