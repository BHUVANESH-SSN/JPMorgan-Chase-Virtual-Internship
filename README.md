## üíº About the Project

The **Midas Core** system is a backend Spring Boot application that:
- Receives transaction messages via **Kafka**
- Applies incentives via an external incentive service
- Stores users and transactions in a **relational database**
- Exposes a REST API to check user balances

This simulation provides experience with real-world technologies used at JPMorgan Chase & Co., including microservices, messaging systems, automated testing, and external service integration.

## üì¶ Task 2: Kafka Integration ‚Äì Midas Core Message Listener

### üß† Background

To improve system architecture, **Midas** introduced a **message queue** (Kafka) between its frontend and backend. This design enables:

- **Decoupling**: Independent development and deployment of frontend/backend.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Transactions can queue during backend overloads, preventing user disruption.
- **Scalability**: Kafka supports multiple producers and consumers for seamless scaling.

### üõ†Ô∏è Objective

Integrate **Apache Kafka** into Midas Core by implementing a **Kafka Listener** that:

- Reads the **Kafka topic name** from `application.yml`.
- Listens to and **deserializes incoming transactions** using the provided `Transaction` class.
- Establishes a consumer that requires no manual host/port configuration (handled by embedded Kafka for testing).

### ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

- Implemented a **Spring Kafka Listener** component.
- Configured it to dynamically read the topic name via `${...}` notation in `application.yml`.
- Verified that incoming messages are correctly deserialized into Java objects.

```java
@KafkaListener(topics = "${kafka.topic.name}", groupId = "midas-core")
public void listen(Transaction transaction) {
    // Logging or storing incoming transaction
}
```

## üß† Kafka Integration Quiz

### ‚ùì Q1: What list reflects the amount attached to the first four transactions received by Midas Core?

**Options:**

A. `122.86, 42.87, 161.79, 22.22`  
B. `546.57, 90.88, 161.79, 12.14`  
C. `34.33, 161.79, 55.22, 42.87`  
D. `66.70, 16.44, 2333.58, 11.33`

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer:  
**A. `122.86, 42.87, 161.79, 22.22`**

These values represent the amounts from the **first four transactions successfully received** by Midas Core via the Kafka listener.

---
## üßæ Task 3 Summary: Database (H2) Integration and Transaction Validation

### üìò Background

In this task, the goal was to integrate a **SQL database** (specifically **H2**) with Midas Core to persist financial transactions. SQL databases are preferred in financial systems due to their reliability and consistency during failure scenarios. Though **H2** is not suitable for production, it offers strong integration with **Spring Boot** and is ideal for local development.

To ensure portability, the system uses **Spring Data JPA**, allowing future replacement of H2 with a production-grade SQL solution with minimal changes.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Task Objective

**Implement transaction validation and persistence logic in Midas Core.**

#### Validation Criteria:
A transaction is considered **valid** if:
- ‚úÖ `senderId` is valid
- ‚úÖ `recipientId` is valid
- ‚úÖ `sender.balance >= transaction.amount`

If **valid**:
- Transaction is saved to the database
- Balances of sender and recipient are updated accordingly

If **invalid**:
- Transaction is discarded
- No changes made to the database

---

### üß± Key Implementations

- Created a new entity: `TransactionRecord`
- Defined `@ManyToOne` relationships between `TransactionRecord` and `UserRecord`
- Integrated Spring Data JPA for repository layer
- Used H2 as the in-memory test database

---

### ‚úÖ Task Verification

After executing the Kafka consumer and processing all transactions, the balance of the user `waldorf` was inspected using a debugger.

### üí∞ Answer (Waldorf's Balance after processing):  
**`627`**

---

## üíº Task 4 REST API Integration

### üß† Background

The Midas system is designed with **modular architecture**. The **Incentive API** is managed by another team and acts as a **black box**, exposing only a single REST endpoint. This decoupling:
- Promotes **team independence**
- Prevents unintentional breakage across components
- Leverages **REST as a contract**, ensuring stable communication

This client-server model uses RESTful POST requests to send validated transaction data and receive incentive information in return.

---

### üéØ Task Objective

Integrate the **Incentive API** (exposed via a `.jar` running on `localhost:8080`) with Midas Core.

#### API Details:
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8080/incentive`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**: `Transaction` object (JSON)
- **Response**: `Incentive` object ‚Üí `amount` (float ‚â• 0)

#### Expected Behavior:
1. Validate transaction.
2. Call the Incentive API using `RestTemplate`.
3. Add the incentive amount to the **recipient's** balance.
4. Do **not** deduct the incentive from the sender.

---

### üîß Implementation Summary

- Used `RestTemplate` to call external API.
- Let Spring handle object serialization (`Transaction` ‚Üî JSON).
- Deserialized `Incentive` response and updated transaction.
- Persisted incentive amount in a new field.
- Updated database balances accordingly.

---

### ‚úÖ Task Verification

After integrating the Incentive API and executing `TaskFourTests`, the debugger revealed:

### üí∞ **Final Balance of `wilbur`: `3089`**

---

## ‚úÖ Task 5 REST API Controller

### üß† Background

To support financial clarity for users, the Midas Core system needs an API that allows users to **query their account balances**. While there are architectural arguments for creating a separate microservice, for now, this balance query functionality is added **directly to Midas Core** to:

- Minimize deployment and maintenance overhead
- Take advantage of Spring Boot‚Äôs simple REST controller creation
- Maintain speed and simplicity for a minor feature

> If the querying logic becomes more complex in the future, the balance endpoint can easily be refactored into its own component.

---

### üéØ Task Objective

Add a **REST endpoint** to Midas Core to expose user balances.

#### üîß Endpoint Requirements:
- **Path**: `/balance`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Param**: `userId` as a request parameter
- **Return**: JSON response of `Balance` object
- **Behavior**:
  - If the user exists: return actual balance.
  - If the user does **not** exist: return `Balance {amount=0.0}`.
- **Port**: `33400`
- **Do not modify** the `Balance` class‚Äô `toString()` method.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Summary

- Created a REST controller in the Midas Core module
- Used `@GetMapping("/balance")` to define endpoint
- Injected `UserRepository` to fetch balances
- Returned new `Balance` instance containing user‚Äôs balance
- Ensured compatibility with `TaskFiveTests`
- Ran Incentive API (`transaction-incentive-api.jar`) concurrently

---

### üß™ Task Verification Output
```bash
---begin output ‚Äî
Balance {amount=0.0}
Balance {amount=1326.98}
Balance {amount=2567.52}
Balance {amount=2740.33}
Balance {amount=140.96999}
Balance {amount=10.419973}
Balance {amount=845.49005}
Balance {amount=657.49}
Balance {amount=99.189995}
Balance {amount=3434.0002}
Balance {amount=2157.1902}
Balance {amount=779421.3}
